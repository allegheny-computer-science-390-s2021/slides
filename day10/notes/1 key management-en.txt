As we’ve previously mentioned, Bitcoin is all about granting real-world entities virtual
identities.
Through these Bitcoin identities, we can easily authenticate ownership and send bitcoins between
users.
Also as mentioned previously, the private key is what unlocks a virtual identity.
It’s what gives access to a Bitcoin address.
But how do we actually protect these private keys?
How do we make sure that we’re not subject to identity theft?
