There’s a lot of wallets out there, definitely a lot more than what we’ve gone over, and
that’s why users have to do their own research to find the wallet that’s best for them.
For example, oftentimes you have to trade off between convenience and security.
Coinbase.com is very easy to use, but they actually store your private keys on the cloud,
and you never get to see it.
Some people don’t like this because you’re putting trust in a powerful, trusted third
party -- Coinbase in this case.
However, others are willing to trade this for the convenience of having their bitcoin
at their fingertips through an easy to use website.
On the other hand, wallets like Mycelium and Electrum do not hold anyone’s private keys
on the cloud.
Users hold their own private keys and are responsible for their own funds.
There’s no recourse from these services in case someone loses their private key.
The benefit of course, is security, since no one else but you controls your private
keys.
However, it’s a huge responsibility and burden, especially for casual Bitcoin users.
So at the end of the day, your choice of wallet is really up to you as an individual.
Whether you’re more partial to convenience features such as payment via smartphones and
QR codes, or fancy multisignature wallets, or go the extra mile to use a hardware wallet,
print out a paper wallet, or memorize a brain wallet… it all boils down to your personal
needs.
