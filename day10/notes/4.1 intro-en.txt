The first type of user we’ll be talking about is the most common Bitcoin user.
Doesn’t have the entire blockchain downloaded, and doesn't need fancy functionality.
Just a wallet to help manage keys, and this type of user can send and receive bitcoins
with the rest of the network.
As we’ll soon find out, wallets come in many different shapes and sizes -- hosted
on the web, on your computer, digital, or physical.
